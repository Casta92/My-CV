# My-CV
This is my CV
This is my resume, where you can see the implementation of my first website with experience in the construction sector that I had during my career as a civil engineer and also, how I have evolved thanks to bootcamps and self-study. My desire is to get a job in the frontend area and to be able to make the change in my profession, since I am passionate about the whole world of technology.
